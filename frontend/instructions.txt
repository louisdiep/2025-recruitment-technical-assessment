Hi!
- Thanks for checking out my application, I've completed the main task and Stretch Task 1
using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- You can run my website by cloning the repo, running npm install http-server and 
hosting a server locally using http-server. Please reach out to me if you have any difficulties!
